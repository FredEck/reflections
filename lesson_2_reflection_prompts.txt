What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	the .git file/repository is created to track commit history.  It was to be done
	to run commands like git diff and dig log to know what repository to use/compare.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area allows you to get some changes ready before a full commit to the repository.
	I guess it would allow you to add them as you finish them, but maybe not before all files
	related to the full commit are ready (not sure).

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
	You can run git diff --staged to see what is about to be committed to determine
	if all changes are part of one logical change.
