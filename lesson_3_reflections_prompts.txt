When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So you can access in multiple places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something locally that you don't want overwritten by what is in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are clones in GitHub only.  Clones can be done from git.  Branches can exist anywhere, but represent various code paths and the commits which make them up.
