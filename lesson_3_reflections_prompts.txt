When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

So you can access in multiple places.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something locally that you don't want overwritten by what is in the remote repository.
